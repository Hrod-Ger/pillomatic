# What is this?
This is our RLP project. It is a pill dispenser that can classify the pills given and distribute them at the correct date and time.
Our main goal with this project is to make easier the life of the people with our robot.

# Requirements
For running each sample code:
- Python 3.9.x
- NumPy
- time
- Matplotlib
- RPi.GPIO
- cv2

# Algorithms
We use one algorithm to detect via a WebCam which colour is the pill in order to classify it:

# Use-case
This project can be used to classify pills or small objects by their colour.

# Contribution
You can contribute to improve this project!
